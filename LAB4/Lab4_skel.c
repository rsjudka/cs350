// *** SKELETON -- Replace the STUB comments with real code ****
// This skeleton doesn't compile as is.

// CS 350, Spring 2016
// Lab 4 -- Breaking up a bitstring
//
// Illinois Institute of Technology, (c) 2016, James Sasaki
//

// This program processes each line of a file; the filename is
// specified as a command-line argument (argv[1]) or defaults to
// Lab4_data.txt. Each line should contain a hex integer value and
// two decimal integers, len1 and len2. We find the leftmost len1
// bits of the value, the next len2 bits of the value, and the
// rightmost len3 = (32 - (len1 + len2)) remaining bits. (All 3
// values should be > 0 else we signal an error and skip to the
// next line of input.)  We print the three bitstrings in hex and
// in decimal. The leftmost string is unsigned, the middle string
// is in 1's complement, and the rightmost string is in 2's
// complement.

// General instructions (for the skeleton):
// Replace all STUB code with actual code.  You don't have
// to use this skeleton, with the warning that this code
// (yours and the skeleton's) are fair game for tests.
